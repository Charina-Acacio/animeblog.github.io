                    <p>IH has been obvious since the pilot chapter. Ichigo and Orihime had mutual romantic feelings for each other in the bleach prototype, Kubo’s original plan for bleach. Here’s a post on it.</p>

<p>If you really, truly want to argue that Ichigo and Orihime “barely had any moments!” luckily, I was insane enough to create a masterpost with links to every single IH moment in the manga (which had to be split in half because it literally broke due to having too many links on it). Part One is here, Part Two is here. It has over 377 links. Say what you will, but IchiHime has the most moments of any other pairing by a landslide (particularly in the final arc, which was most telling for canon).</p>

<p>The last 15 chapters of the manga were filled with positive IchiHime moments and development. Kubo, building up to the final chapter, knowing that there wasn’t a lot of time left, and with so many other options to choose from (including other ships) willingly chose to write about IchiHime. He did that.</p>

<p>The amount of focus that was put on Ichigo’s desire to protect Orihime specifically is MASSIVE. It was made more than apparent how much Ichigo cared about Orihime and how important she was to him, by the level of focus that was put on Ichigo’s protectiveness over her, specifically. It’s something that singled her out as special and set her apart from the others, time and time again. It was consistently emphasized in the manga, and, conversely, so too was Orihime’s desire to protect Ichigo specifically. Their mutual desires to protect each other was a recurring theme.</p>

<p>It isn’t just Orihime’s physical well-being that Ichigo is protective of; he’s always been protective of her emotional well-being, too. He’s considerate of her feelings and does not like it when people are mean to her. He has jumped to her defense multiple times.Throughout the series, most of Ichigo’s enemies have targeted Orihime specifically just to get to him or taunt him into a fight, further singling her out and highlighting the obvious soft spot Ichigo has for her. This is a CLASSIC romantic trope, and a recurring theme Kubo used with IchiHime again and again.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Arc</h2>

                    <p>The difference between here and the beginning of the story is evident. They’ve grown closer, become better friends, they share manga, they’re more comfortable with each other, although Orihime is still nervous around him. Ichigo hasn’t yet figured out why.</p>
                        <img src="http://orig03.deviantart.net/cf7f/f/2016/304/d/c/tumblr_inline_oc2i6gmnvx1rc2eha_500_by_naomilen-damtem1.png">
                    <p>They developed both on and off the battlefield. They became closer friends, their bond strengthened, their importance to each other and how much they care for each other deepened. You can see the growth in each arc, from one to the next. It’s tangible.</p>

                    <blockquote>The final arc was a goldmine, Kubo made sure to give IH plenty of moments, development, and focus before making it canon.</blockquote>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Kazui Kurosaki</h2>

                    <p>Kazui is a small boy with orange hair and large dark orange eyes. His face closely resembles that of his mother's, having the same shaped eyes and facial curves, while he inherited his father's spiky hair, though his hair is noticeably smoother than Ichigo's. He wears a green hoodie. When he transforms into a Shinigami, he wears the standard Shinigami robe, though he retains his hoodie.</p>

                    <p>Kazui is adventurous, regularly making uninvited appearances in Hiyori Sarugaki's home and freely interacting with remnants of Yhwach's Reiatsu.</p>
